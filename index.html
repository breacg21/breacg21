                    <p><b>The Idea</b>:<br>I call this "device" Visual Dream. It's basically a pillow, but it's different from
                    others because inside the pillow for a few reasons. Inside the pillow, there would be sensors
                    all over, and those sensors are picking up your brain waves using the different parts of your 
                    brain. The waves would then be calculated, measured, and stored to create multiple pictures
                    that would play the same way a typical video would.

                    <p>Currently there have been various tests conducted by many scientists from a few universities throughout the years. By studying the brainwaves, of their volunteers, 
                    they were able to put together a picture of who they saw using artifical intelligence. The result was a bit creepy but very fascinating.</p>

                    <p><b>The Idea</b>:<br> I don't know about you, but I forget important things all the time. Quite frequently I'll keep thinking
                    of something, but no matter what I do, I forget about it as soon as it becomes relevant. So, what if there was a small device
                    that would stick to you and it could record everything you think about, and put it into writing or a recording for you?
                    It would be small and stick right behind your ear. It could link to your phone or device of choice through bluetooth, and all of your
                    thoughts could be at the tip of your fingers in both voice recordings and/or regular notes.</p>
